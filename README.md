# Recommender-Systems-Implementation

In this project, we will experiment with two algorithms for movie recommendation. In particular, 
we will explore (a) the simple item-item collaborative filtering, and (b) a latent factor model with 
stochastic gradient descent, discussed in our class. We will evaluate the performance of models 
with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and report them to complete this project
